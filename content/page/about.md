# Quick Run-Down

**Jason Nguyen** has been seeking a career in the tech industry since 2012. He has worked in both private and public sectors in a mostly customer-facing capacity, but has grown to love `Linux`, `open-source` projects and `DevOps` culture. Jason is still in school and growing his skillset.

# Extended Bio

Jason Nguyen was first introduced to programming in grade 10. The high school he went to surprisingly offered a Computer & Information Science class and he learned the basics of Visual Basic. Sadly, he didn't like the class and decided to pursue a science undergrad. As a university student, he couldn't motivate himself to stay in the field of academia or science. Ultimately, he decided to drop out and pursue a career in Information Technology instead.

Jason started his first IT job in the [public sector](https://www.tc.gc.ca/) in 2014. He witnessed how quickly technology advances and he realized he needed to adapt and continuously apply his skills. He continued working in mostly Windows exclusive environments and only dabbled in Linux for college course-work. As an IT employee, he interacted with people with various IT specialties and skillsets. He discovered that he wanted more than just applying himself to troubleshooting computer systems and `Windows` administration. Shortly after going back to college to learn about programming, he began an internship at a software company in [Kanata North](https://www.kanatanorthbia.ca/). Jason quickly became immersed in anything `Cloud`, `Docker`, and `Kubernetes` related. Even this website is running as a service on his very own k8s cluster.

Jason is now developing his skills on Linux systems and actively pursuing a career in something DevOps. His résumé/CV can be found [here](https://www.jayngu.com/page/resume/).
